# Option Pricing and Implied Volatility using Neural Networks

This project uses TensorFlow-based Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to price financial options and compute implied volatilities, accelerating traditional numerical methods. The ANN is trained using financial models like Black-Scholes and Heston, offering substantial computational speed improvements without sacrificing accuracy. It also features a Flask backend with a ReactJS frontend for an interactive interface.

## Features
- **Fast and Accurate**: Reduces option pricing and volatility computation time using ANNs.
- **Models Supported**: Black-Scholes, Heston, and other financial models.
- **Numerical Solvers**: Brentâ€™s method, COS method, and Black-Scholes pricing formula.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Flask (backend) and ReactJS (frontend).
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes TensorFlow for efficient model training and inference.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- pandas
